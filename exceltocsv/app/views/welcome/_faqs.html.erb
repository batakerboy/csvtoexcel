			<p align = "justify">- FBI stands for Falco, Biometrics, and iEMS. The Falco and Biometrics Systems are used for the monitoring of the daily time and attendance record of every employee while the iEMS is used by the employees in applying for different requests like overtimes, offsets, undertimes, leaves, official businesses, etc. These three systems produce the input files that will be uploaded in the FBI Integrated System for the generation of reports. There will be two kinds of output that will be generated by the system, the DTR Summary Sheet, containing the summary of the attendance records and requests of all employees, and the Per Employee Reports, containing the daily attendance records and requests per employee. These reports will be used by the HR and Accounting Department to determine the salary of the employees.</p>

			<p align = "justify">- In generating a report, the Falco-Biometrics-iEMS Integrated System needs three input files. These files are the Biometrics CSV, Falco (no filter) TXT, and iEMS CSV files. The Biometrics CSV file can be downloaded from the Mustard Seed Time and Attendance Management System while the Falco TXT file can be exported from the Falco-Ecom Access Control System. Both files record the time in and time out of all employees of the company in both offices. The iEMS CSV file, on the other hand, can be exported from the iRipple Employee Management System. The iEMS checks all requests made by the company’s employees. To generate correct data for the system output, it is expected that all three input files shall have the same date range for the cut-off period (e.g. April 25 – May 8, 2015).</p>

The FBI Integrated System has an archiving feature that allows users to view and download the reports that were generated from the previous cut-off period. All you need to do is go to the Archives tab in the navigation bar. There you will see a list of all the reports that were generated. Beside each report, you will see a “View Report” button and a “Download Report” button. If you want to view a report first before downloading, click the “View Report” button. If you want to download the report directly, click the “Download Report” button.</p>
