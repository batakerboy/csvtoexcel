2.) What is FBI Integration System?
	
	- FBI stands for Falco, Biometrics, and iEMS. The Falco and Biometrics Systems are for the monitoring of the daily time attendance record of every employee while the iEMS System is used by the employees in applying for different requests like overtimes, offsets, undertimes, leaves, official businesses, etc. These three systems produce the input files that will be uploaded to the FBI Integration System for the creation of reports. There will be 2 reports that will be generated, the DTR Summary, containing the summary of the attendance records and requests of all employees, and the Per Employee Reports, containing the daily attendance records and requests per employee. These reports will be used by the HR and Accounting Department to determine the salary of the employees.
